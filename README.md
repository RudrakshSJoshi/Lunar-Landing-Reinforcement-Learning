*Lunar Landing Simulation*

Welcome to the Lunar Landing Simulation project!
This project simulates the experience of landing a spacecraft on the surface of the moon using reinforcement learning techniques and the OpenAI Gym framework.
It provides an interactive environment where users can control the descent of the spacecraft and attempt to land safely on the lunar surface.
